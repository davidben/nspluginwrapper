See the file "COPYING" that is included in the distribution for details.


Overview
--------

nspluginwrapper consists in a proxy plugin and a viewer for NPAPI
compatible plugins. It makes it possible to use 32-bit x86 plugins
like Adobe Flash Player on other platforms like Linux/x86_64, *BSD and
even Linux/ppc.


Quick build notes
-----------------

To simplify the build of the 32-bit viewer, a minimal subset of LSB
Desktop 3.1 is included in this distribution. Hence, you only have
to proceed as follows:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Or, if you prefer from a source package:
$ rpm --rebuild nspluginwrapper.src.rpm


Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------

A Mozilla based browser built with GTK 2 support is currently required
for proper operation. An alternative is Konqueror but it does not yet
support the npruntime scripting API.

On package installation, 32-bit plugins are automatically recognized
provided they are available in the /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins directory.

You can manually install/remove/update plugins with "nspluginwrapper".

   usage: nspluginwrapper [flags] [command [plugin(s)]]

   -h --help               print this message
   -a --auto               set automatic mode for plugins discovery
   -l --list               list plugins currently installed
   -u --update             update plugin(s) currently installed
   -i --install [FILE(S)]  install plugin(s)
   -r --remove [FILE(S)]   remove plugin(s)

[plugin(s)] are full paths to actual plugin binaries (e.g. nppdf.so
for Acrobat Reader, libflashplayer.so for Flash).
